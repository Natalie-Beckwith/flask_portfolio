        <h3>About the P Building</h3>
        <p style="padding-right: 50%;"> The P building is the most creative building in the campus, with it including the vast majority of
        the art-related classes. Some of these classes include Studio Art, Ceramics, AP Mixed Media, and others. Many students flock to this area
        during Night at the Museum, which is an exhibit held every trimester to display the elective work students have done at the end of the trimester. </p>
