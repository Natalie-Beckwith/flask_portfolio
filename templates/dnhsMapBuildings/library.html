        <h3>About the Library</h3>
        <p style="padding-right: 50%;"> The library is the building where many students either go to check out books or to study. This building is
        often very occupied but quiet. The selection of available books is quite vast and that makes this building a very good source for books. Within the library
        there is also a computer lab, which is often used for research projects. The library offers a printing service for a very cheap cost to students that need
        to print their papers at the last minute. Some students have elected themselves to work at the library for 1 of their academic periods as a library
        assistant.</p>
